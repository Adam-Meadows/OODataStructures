1
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,145
Neighbors heard them screaming
at each other, like, for two hours.

2
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,481
Nothing new.
Then they heard the gun go off.

3
[highlight]00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,815
The vice president is scheduled
to preside over a Senate vote todayâ€¦

4
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,235
A crime of passion.

5
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,071
Yeah.

6
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,823
Just look at all the passion on that wall.

7
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,910
Yeah, well, this is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.

8
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,540
The kid see it?

9
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,125
What?

10
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,960
The kid.

11
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,837
What kind of fucking question is that?

12
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:34,468
We are all gonna be real glad when we
get rid of you, Somerset, you know that?

13
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,679
There's always these questions with you.
Did the kid see it?

14
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,390
Who gives a fuck? He's dead.
His wife killed him.

15
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,352
Anything else has nothing to do with us.

16
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,862
Detective Somerset?

17
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,990
I'm Detective Mills.

18
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,576
Lieutenant, I apologize
for interrupting like this...

19
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,371
...just get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

20
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,956
Look, um...

21
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,499
Mills?

22
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,377
I thought we might
find a bar someplace. Sit, talk...

23
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,420
I'd like to get to the precinct.

24
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,674
You know,
not much time for this transition thing.

25
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,594
I meant to ask you something,
when we spoke on the phone before.

26
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,971
Yeah.

27
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,723
Why here?

28
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,559
I don't follow.

29
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,770
Well, all this effort to get transferred.

30
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,691
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

31
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,734
I guess for the same reasons as you.

32
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:36,113
Or the same reasons you had
before you decided to quit, yeah?

33
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,200
You just met me.

34
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,412
Maybe I'm not understanding
the question.

35
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,206
It's very simple.

36
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,752
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

37
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,297
I've just never seen it done
that way before.

38
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,883
I thought I could do some good.
It would be great...

39
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,760
...if we didn't start out
kicking each other in the balls.

40
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,932
If you're calling the shots, lieutenant...
Yes.

41
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,312
I want you to look
and I want you to listen, okay?

42
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,939
Now, I wasn't standing around
guarding the Taco Bell.

43
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,192
I've worked Homicide five years.
Not here.

44
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,401
I understand that.

45
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:19,114
Well, over the next seven days, detective,
you'll do me the favor of remembering that.

46
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,629
MAN 1: Hey, hey. I almost died.

47
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,238
MAN 2:
Shut the fuck up down there!

48
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,382
Hello? Yeah.

49
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,967
Okay.

50
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,386
Say it again.

51
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,684
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

52
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,316
Serpico's gotta go.

53
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:27,362
Yeah, well, you might wanna get rid
of this little crusty.

54
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,156
This eye, Serpico.

55
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,782
Did you get it?
Got it.

56
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,284
Good.

57
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,010
Coffee? No?

58
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,559
Nothing's been touched.
Everything's like I found it.

59
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,394
What time was death established?

60
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,062
Like I said...

61
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,564
...I didn't touch anything.

62
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,735
But he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti
for about 45 minutes now.

63
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,654
Wait a minute.
No one bothers with vital signs?

64
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,989
Did I stutter?

65
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,534
This guy ain't breathing
unless he started breathing spaghetti sauce.

66
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,913
MILLS: So that's how it's done around here?
DAVIS: I beg your pardon, detective.

67
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,082
But this guy's been sitting
in a pile of his own piss and shit.

68
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,418
If he wasn't dead,
he would've stood up by now.

69
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,754
All right, thank you, officer.
Okay.

70
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,756
Thank you.

71
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,850
I wonder.

72
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:45,065
What exactly was the point of the
conversation you were about to get into?

73
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,274
MILLS: Don't know.

74
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,362
How many times has Barney Fife
found dead bodies that weren't dead?

75
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,406
Drop it.

76
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,641
Oof.

77
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,357
Somebody phone Guinness.
I think we've got a record here.

78
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,126
Better Homes and Gardens.

79
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,670
Oof.

80
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,179
Who said this was murder?

81
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,223
No one.

82
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,520
Guy's heart's gotta be the size
of a canned ham.

83
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,987
If this isn't a coronary,
well, ha, ha, I don't know.

84
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,839
Whoops.

85
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,348
How about that?

86
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,984
We had this case once.

87
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,029
Guy dead on the ground.

88
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,364
Knife in his back.

89
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,574
Gotta be murder, right?

90
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,410
Fuck.

91
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,789
Anyway,
big insurance policy involved, yeah?

92
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:10,669
So the guy took the tip of the blade,
stuck it in his own shoulder blades.

93
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,506
And he must've screwed up a few times
because there was multiples back there.

94
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,591
Could you please be quiet?

95
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,143
Wait a minute.

96
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,687
What?

97
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,233
Got a bucket here.

98
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:34,943
What's in it?

99
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,823
Agh!

100
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,908
Oh, God.

101
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,702
Fucking vomit.

102
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,288
Any blood in it?

103
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,500
I didn't see any. Help yourself.

104
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,632
Are you thinking it's poison?

105
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,177
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

106
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,971
Thinking it's poison, Somerset?

107
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,599
You girls have got Forensics
waiting outside.

108
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,687
Don't know if we'll all fit, though.
There's room, light's the problem.

109
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,647
Hi, how are you?
Hey.

110
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:17,110
Detective Mills, would you go help
the officers question the neighbors?

111
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,323
What?
Send in Forensics on your way out, please.

112
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,966
He's dead.

113
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,011
Thank you, doctor.

114
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:52,187
You've seen my files, right?
You seen the things I've done.

115
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,813
Nope.

116
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,651
I did my time on door-to-doors
and walking the beat.

117
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,154
I did that shit for a long time.

118
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,031
And?

119
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,534
Badge on my belt says "detective."
That's the same as yours.

120
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,413
Look, I made a decision.

121
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,416
I had to consider
the integrity of the scene.

122
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,295
Couldn't worry whether you thought you
were getting enough on the playing field.

123
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,838
Hey, man...

124
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,593
...just don't be jerking me off,
that's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.

125
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,935
He's been dead a long time.

126
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,145
And I can tell you,
it was not from poison.

127
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,480
Oh, man.

128
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,816
How does someone
let themselves go like that?

129
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,569
It took four orderlies
just to get him on the table.

130
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,783
How'd the fat fuck
ever fit out his front door?

131
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,952
Please. It's obvious he was a shut-in.

132
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,537
Now, look at this.

133
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,247
See how big this stomach is?

134
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,250
And the strange thing is, it stretches.

135
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,628
Here. Look at the size of the cardiac orifice,
where the food...

136
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,881
Wait, I see what you're pointing out,
but that means nothing to me.

137
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,510
Okay. He's got lines of distention
across the duodenum.

138
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,596
And the interior wall is ripped open.

139
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,266
This man ate till he burst?

140
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,935
He didn't really burst. Not all the way.

141
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,563
He was hemorrhaging internally.

142
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,942
And there was a hematoma in the rectus
and transverse abdominis muscles.

143
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,443
So he did die by eating.

144
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,153
Yes and no.

145
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,866
What about these bruises up here?

146
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,536
Well, I haven't figured that out yet.

147
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,580
Gun pressed against his head?

148
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,081
Pressed hard enough, sure.

149
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,708
Fuck, yeah.

150
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,794
Marks from the front side,
flush with the muzzle.

151
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,383
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a homicide.

152
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,805
Killer put a bucket beneath him,
kept on serving.

153
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,348
Took his time, too.

154
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,268
Coroner said this could've gone on
more than 12 hours.

155
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,730
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort.

156
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,774
And there was definitely a point
when he passed out.

157
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,485
That's when the killer kicked him
and he burst.

158
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,613
Oof. Sadistic fucker, huh?

159
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,198
When you want somebody
dead, you drive by and shoot.

160
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,410
You don't risk the time it takes
to do this.

161
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,371
Unless the act itself has meaning.
CAPTAIN: Come on.

162
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,334
Somebody had a problem with the fat boy
and decided to torture him.

163
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,501
Simple as that.

164
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,670
In the grocery bags,
we found two receipts.

165
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,173
That means the killer stopped
in the middle...

166
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,467
...and made a second trip
to the supermarket.

167
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,010
So?

168
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,348
Hey, man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.

169
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,891
This is beginning.

170
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,352
We've got one dead guy, not three.

171
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,562
No motive.

172
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,524
Don't even start that big brain of yours
cooking on this, all right?

173
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,527
Please, I'd like to be reassigned.

174
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,737
MILLS: What?
CAPTAIN: What?

175
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,865
What, whoa?
What in the hell are you talking about?

176
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,409
This can't be my last duty.

177
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,536
It's just gonna go on and on and on.

178
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,746
You're retiring.

179
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,082
Six more days
and you're all the way gone.

180
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,459
Won't be the first time you've left unfinished...

181
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,171
Those other cases were taken
as close to conclusion as humanly possible.

182
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,714
And if I may speak freely?

183
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,216
We're all friends here.

184
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,886
This should not be his first assignment.
Oh, come on, I knew it.

185
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,180
This is not my first assignment, you dick.

186
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,431
It's too soon for him.

187
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,393
Hey, man, I'm right here.
You can say that shit to my face.

188
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,228
Captain...
It's too soon for you.

189
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,731
Captain, if we can just talk in private?

190
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,942
This isn't working. It's a personal thing.

191
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,652
Maybe...
Just shut up, Mills.

192
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,739
Look, I don't have anyone else
to put on this and you know it.

193
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,701
This is Metro. You don't just get to swap.

194
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,494
Give it to me.

195
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,955
Say what?
Yeah, he doesn't want it, fuck him.

196
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,249
Sorry, but see you later. Have a nice time.

197
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,085
Give it to me.
No, I'm putting you on something else.

198
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,131
Go on, Mills.

199
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,882
Just go on.

200
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,848
I'm sorry, old buddy.

201
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,518
But it looks like you're stuck
cleaning up the fat man.

202
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,495
All right, here we go. Quiet down.

203
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,416
All right, calm down. Calm down.

204
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,293
Quiet down.

205
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,837
Calm down. Quiet down.

206
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,840
Now, here's how it's gonna work.

207
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,927
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes
and 10 minutes only.

208
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,431
If those questions do not come in a calm,
sane and orderly fashion...

209
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,807
...I'm on my way out here.

210
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,809
Detective? Detective?

211
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,353
Can I have a moment of your time?
No.

212
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,195
I will not discuss the details
of this ongoing investigation...

213
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,946
...so don't even bother asking.

214
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,867
MAN 1 [OVER RADIO]:
I've got shopping tools...

215
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,244
WOMAN [OVER RADIO]:
That's 25 Berlin.

216
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,085
MAN 2: That looks like him.

217
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,255
WOMAN [OVER RADIO]:
Three items for your case number.

218
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,260
What you guys got for me?
MAN 3: Nothing yet, boss.

219
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,392
Why don't you guys, uh,
go get a coffee, huh?

220
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,354
WOMAN [ON TV]:
We have this breaking story for you.

221
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,397
We're going to go live downtown...

222
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,859
...where defense attorney Eli Gould
was found murdered this morning.

223
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,696
District Attorney Martin Talbot
is taking questions from reporters.

224
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,742
REPORTER 1:
There could be a conflict of interest...

225
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,038
That is ridiculous to the point of being
offensive. There is no conflict whatsoever.

226
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,873
And any claim that there could be...

227
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,292
...is irresponsible.
REPORTER 2: Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot.

228
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,294
Hold on.
REPORTER 3: It's rumored you're far...

229
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,131
...from apprehending a suspect.
TALBOT: I've come from a meeting...

230
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,925
...of law enforcement officials
and they've assured me...

231
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,804
...they have their very best men on this.

232
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:05,143
This will be the very definition
of swift justice.

233
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,751
CAPTAIN: Pardon me, George.

234
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,717
Somerset.
Come in.

235
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,429
Have you heard the news?
SOMERSET: Nope, haven't heard.

236
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,390
Eli Gould was found murdered
this morning.

237
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,311
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.

238
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,439
Wrote the word "greed" on the floor.

239
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,530
Greed?
CAPTAIN: Yeah, in blood.

240
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,074
Mills is heading up the investigation.

241
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,535
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me?

242
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,622
Could you not do that, please?

243
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,165
Oh, okay.

244
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,126
Well, good for him.

245
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,630
What in the hell are you gonna do
with yourself out there, Somerset?

246
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,757
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.

247
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,133
Fix my house.

248
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,968
Don't you feel it?

249
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,304
Don't you feel that feeling?

250
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,432
You're not gonna be a cop anymore.

251
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,643
That's the whole idea.

252
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,938
I don't think you're leaving.

253
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,649
Hell, you can't leave all this.

254
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,569
Guy's out walking his dog.

255
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,446
Gets attacked.

256
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,324
His watch is taken, his wallet.

257
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,911
While he's lying there
on the sidewalk, helpless...

258
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,373
...his attacker stabs him in both eyes.

259
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,293
This happened just last night
about four blocks from here.

260
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,338
Yeah, I read about it.

261
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,133
I don't understand this place any longer.
It's the way it's always been.

262
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,510
Maybe you're right.

263
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,011
CAPTAIN: You do this work.

264
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,848
You were made for it
and I don't think you can deny that.

265
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,559
Maybe I'm wrong.

266
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:15,147
Oh, uh, the coroner
sent this down for you.

267
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:19,360
Found them in fat boy's stomach,
mixed in with food.

268
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,447
Looks like plastic, little pieces of plastic.
Set them on the desk, please.

269
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,245
They were, uh...

270
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,454
They were fed to him.

271
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,764
Oh, Lord.

272
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,982
This was found on the wall
behind the refrigerator...

273
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,318
...in the obesity murder scene.

274
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,116
"Long is the way and hard
that out of hell leads up to light."

275
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,118
It's from Milton.

276
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,203
Paradise Lost.

277
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,414
All right, I'm confused.

278
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,417
It means that this is beginning.

279
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,586
This was found
behind the same refrigerator.

280
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,880
Written in grease.

281
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,758
There are seven deadly sins, captain.

282
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,593
Gluttony.

283
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,514
Greed.

284
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,978
Sloth, wrath, pride, lust...

285
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,856
...and envy.

286
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,233
Seven.
Hold on.

287
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,610
This is not even my desk.

288
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,780
You can expect five more of these.

289
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,616
Now, wait a minute.

290
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,787
I can't get involved in this.

291
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,082
Somerset.

292
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,959
He wanted it.

293
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,255
Damn.
I'm all over it.

294
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,884
MAN: What's wrong with you?

295
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,665
Where you headed?

296
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,587
Far away from here.

297
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,390
SOMERSET: Thanks, George.
GEORGE: How you doing?

298
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,184
Just a few things to look up.

299
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,269
GEORGE:
Okay. Sit where you'd like.

300
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,813
How's everybody?

301
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,108
MAN 1: Hi, Smiley.

302
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,778
MAN 2: Come on, George,
the cards are getting cold.

303
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,279
Duty calls.

304
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,464
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

305
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,007
I'll never understand.

306
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,135
All these books...

307
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,638
...a world of knowledge
at your fingertips.

308
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,390
What do you do?

309
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,308
You play poker all night.

310
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,644
MAN 3: Hey, we got culture.

311
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,813
Yeah, we got culture
coming out of our asses.

312
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,817
MAN 2: All right.

313
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,027
How's this for culture?

314
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,478
You know, Smiley...

315
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,148
...you're really gonna miss us.

316
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,401
I just might.

317
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,877
Fucking Dante.

318
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:01,423
Goddamn poetry-writing faggot
piece of shit.

319
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,175
Fucker.

320
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,392
Yeah?

321
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,938
Good work, officer.

322
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,905
Thank you, Lord.

323
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,331
Oh, I'm sorry.

324
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,584
Be out of your way in a second.

325
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,849
You want your chair?
No. You go ahead.

326
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,433
MILLS: Yeah?

327
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,473
Phone.

328
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,100
It's a package deal.

329
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,310
Comes with the office.

330
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,983
Mills.
TRACY [OVER PHONE]: Honey.

331
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,737
Are you okay, something wrong?
No.

332
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:51,199
You dingleberry, I, uh, told you
not to call me here when I'm working.

333
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,161
Yeah. Why?

334
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,913
Why?

335
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,374
Why?
Come on.

336
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,338
Okay.

337
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,009
It's my wife.

338
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,552
Sorry?

339
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,472
She'd like to speak to you.

340
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,275
Uh, this is Detective Somerset.

341
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,361
Oh, it's nice to speak with you.

342
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,197
Well, it's nice to talk to you too.

343
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,201
I appreciate the offer, but...

344
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,998
Well, in that case I'd be delighted.
Great.

345
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,168
Yes, thank you very much.
Thank you. See you later.

346
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,670
Bye.

347
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,173
Hon, what...?

348
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,849
Well?

349
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,394
Sorry? Oh, uh.
What?

350
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,105
I've been invited to a late supper
at your apartment.

351
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,690
I accepted.

352
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,234
At my... How's that?

353
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,986
Tonight.

354
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,489
WOMAN [OVER RADIO]:
Twenty-one-fifty-seven.

355
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,536
Hello, men.

356
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,871
Hi, loser.
Hi, idiot.

357
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,874
This is Tracy.

358
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,128
Somerset.
Hello.

359
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,798
I'm very happy to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

360
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,925
Except, of course, your first name.

361
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,553
It's William.

362
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,016
Hmm, well, it's a good name, William.

363
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,435
William, I'd like you to meet David.

364
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,146
David, this is William.
Okay, all right, I'm gonna...

365
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,439
I'll be right back.

366
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,733
How are the kids?
Good, they're in the room.

367
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,359
Come on in.

368
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,320
Oh, good dogs.

369
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,365
How are you, good dogs?
How are you, pretty?

370
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:02,456
How are you?

371
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,708
You are?

372
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,295
SOMERSET: Smells good.
What?

373
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,880
Uh.
Oh.

374
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,673
Yeah. I mean, thank you.

375
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,720
Um, please have a seat, if you like.
Would you like something to drink?

376
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,346
Uh, no. No, thanks.

377
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,016
I'll wait.
Okay, you can just throw that anywhere.

378
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:25,520
You'll have to excuse all this mess.
You know, we're still unpacking.

379
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,983
I understand you two
were high school sweethearts.

380
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,318
TRACY: Mm-hm.

381
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,738
Pretty hokey, huh?

382
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,324
You know something?

383
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,702
I knew on our first date
that this was the guy I was gonna marry.

384
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,412
Really?
Mm-hm.

385
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,916
He was the funniest guy I'd ever met.

386
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,296
Really?

387
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,927
Well, it's kind of rare nowadays,
you know.

388
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,847
I mean, that level of commitment.

389
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,145
Oh, don't worry.

390
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,190
I won't wear it to the dinner table.
No, ha, ha.

391
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,860
I, uh... You know, no matter how
often I see guns, I just...

392
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,988
I can't get used to them.

393
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,907
Same here.

394
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,877
Why aren't you married, William?

395
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,213
Oh, Trace, what the hell?

396
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,507
I was close once.

397
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,300
It just didn't happen.

398
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,761
It surprises me.

399
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,930
It really does.

400
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,391
Well...

401
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:49,855
Anyone who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me disagreeable.

402
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,815
Just ask your husband.

403
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,316
Very true.

404
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,735
Very, very true.

405
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,530
So how long have you lived here?

406
00:35:58,948 --> 00:35:59,990
Too long.

407
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,287
How are you liking it?

408
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:11,585
You know, takes time, settle in.

409
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,962
It'll be good.

410
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,256
Well, you get numb after awhile.

411
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,092
There are things to any city.

412
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,933
Subway.

413
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:30,061
It will go away in a minute.
It's nothing.

414
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,900
Real estate guy.

415
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,401
Fucking piece of...

416
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,361
Sorry, honey. He's...

417
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,864
He shows us the place a few times.

418
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,908
I think he's good. He's efficient.

419
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,951
Tracy really likes him.

420
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,456
Then I start wondering why will he only
bring us here five minutes at a time, yeah?

421
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,333
We found out the first night.

422
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:56,755
The soothing, relaxing,
vibrating home, huh?

423
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,806
I'm sorry.

424
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,440
Yeah, all right, laugh it up.

425
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,528
I don't know why you're laughing.

426
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,534
All right, already.

427
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,790
The guy would've had to get in...

428
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,501
...before the office was closed
and security tightened.

429
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,503
Now, Gould would've been working late.

430
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,714
I'm certain. He was the biggest
defense lawyer in town.

431
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:40,924
Infamous, really.

432
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,301
Now listen,
body was found on Tuesday morning.

433
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:47,639
The office was closed on Monday, which
means the guy could've gotten in Friday...

434
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:52,060
...laid low till the cleaning crew left then
had his way with Gould all day Saturday...

435
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,771
...Sunday, maybe even Monday.

436
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,690
Hey, look at this.

437
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,109
Gould was bound, right arm almost free.

438
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,777
He was handed a butcher's knife.

439
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,572
Check out the scale.

440
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,991
SOMERSET: A pound of flesh?

441
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,118
Yeah.

442
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,715
Merchant of Venice.
Didn't see it.

443
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:25,051
"This task done and he would go free."

444
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:28,388
I'm telling you that chair
was soaked through with sweat.

445
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,307
Of course.

446
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,768
The killer would've wanted Gould
to take his time...

447
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:37,439
...to sit and decide
which cut to make first.

448
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,107
Imagine it.

449
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,568
There's a gun in your face.

450
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,654
Which part of your body is expendable?

451
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,656
What about the love handle?

452
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,576
Cut along the side of his own stomach.

453
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,746
All right, let's take a fresh look at these.

454
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,206
Even though the corpse is there,
look through it.

455
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,083
Edit out the initial shock.

456
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:02,672
Trick is to find one item,
one detail and focus on it...

457
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,383
...until it's an exhausted possibility.

458
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,344
Just gonna get another beer. Beer?

459
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,721
Uh, wine, please.

460
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,773
He's preaching.

461
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,733
He's punishing.

462
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,863
The sins were used in medieval sermons.

463
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,991
There were seven cardinal virtues
and seven deadly sins...

464
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,451
...used as teaching tools.

465
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like in, uh, The Parson's Tale and...

466
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,789
What's this? Uh, Dante.

467
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,166
You read them?
Yeah.

468
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,419
Well, parts.
Hey, remember in, uh, Purgatory?

469
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,963
Dante and his buddy,
they're climbing up the hill...

470
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,299
...they're checking out
all the sinners, yeah?

471
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,761
Yeah, the seven terraces of purgation.
Yeah, yeah, right.

472
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:53,181
But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.

473
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:57,352
Yeah, well, for now, let's just consider
that the books were the killer's inspiration.

474
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,980
The sermons
were about atonement for sin.

475
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,274
These murders are like forced attrition.

476
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,027
Forced what?
Attrition.

477
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,988
It's when you regret your sins,
but not because you love God.

478
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:12,200
Oh, like because someone's sticking
a fucking gun in your face.

479
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,827
Mm-hm.

480
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,581
No fingerprints.
Nope.

481
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:22,001
Totally unrelated victims.
Yup.

482
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,629
And no witnesses of any kind.

483
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,464
Which I don't get.

484
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,884
Because the fucker had to get back out.

485
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:34,973
Well, in any major city,
minding your own business is a science.

486
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,018
The first thing they teach women
in rape prevention is never cry for help.

487
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,354
Always yell "Fire."

488
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,814
Nobody answers to "Help."

489
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,899
You holler "fire," they come running.

490
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,734
That's fucked up.

491
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:50,196
He must've left another puzzle piece.

492
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,907
You know what?

493
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:56,369
Thank you for talking this out,
but I gotta sleep.

494
00:40:56,745 --> 00:41:00,165
Walk the dogs.
This is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity.

495
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:03,042
I'm still leaving at the end of the week.
Oh, shit.

496
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,836
No, wait, wait.

497
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,840
Gould's wife.
She was out of town at the time.

498
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,218
So this means she saw something.
What if it's a threat?

499
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:15,054
Well, I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.

500
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,858
SOMERSET:
What if it isn't something she has seen?

501
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:31,112
But something she's supposed to see,
but hasn't been given a chance?

502
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,989
Yeah, okay. What?

503
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,116
I don't know.

504
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,995
But that's the one thing.

505
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,667
MILLS: Sign us in.

506
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,919
Gotta see Mrs. Gould.

507
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,421
GOULD:
...treat me like a prisoner.

508
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,758
Why do you have a phone
if I can't make long distance phone calls?

509
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,009
Mrs. Gould?

510
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,594
GOULD:
Don't treat people like this.

511
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,102
Mrs. Gould, I am sorry. I truly am.

512
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,604
I don't understand.

513
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:51,859
Okay, I need you
to look at each photo very carefully.

514
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:56,990
Look and see if there's anything strange
or out of place.

515
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,157
Um, anything at all.

516
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,244
I don't see anything.
You're sure?

517
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,913
Please, I just... I can't do this right now.

518
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,707
Okay.

519
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,750
SOMERSET [WHISPERS]:
It's got to be now.

520
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,211
There may be something
we haven't seen.

521
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,471
GOULD: Wait.

522
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,890
What?
Here.

523
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,856
This painting, it's upside down.

524
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,240
You sure your men didn't move this?
No, no.

525
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,118
Those shots were taken before forensics.

526
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,664
Nothing.

527
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,209
There's gotta be something.

528
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,389
Moved the screws to rehang it.
Yep.

529
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,437
What the fuck is that?

530
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,273
Switchblade.

531
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,116
Goddamn it.

532
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,081
There must be something.

533
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,380
He didn't paint the fucking thing.

534
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,057
No, he's fucking with us,
that's what he's doing.

535
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,143
See this? This is us.

536
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,812
Yeah.

537
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,605
Just wait a minute.

538
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,151
Now Somerset's climbing
on the furniture.

539
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,278
Just wait a minute.

540
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,993
You're kidding me.

541
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,621
Call the Print Lab.

542
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,461
Oh, man.

543
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,969
Honestly, have you ever
seen anything like this?

544
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,097
No.

545
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,977
MAN: I can tell you, guys,
just by looking at the swirl pattern...

546
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,771
...they're not the victim's fingerprints.

547
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:48,494
I don't know, man.
I say he's whacked enough.

548
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,913
It doesn't fit.

549
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,459
He doesn't wants us to help him stop.
MILLS: Who knows?

550
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:58,629
So many freaks out there doing
their little evil deeds they don't wanna do.

551
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,883
"The voices made me do it.
My dog made me do it.

552
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,843
Jodie Foster told me to do it."

553
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,597
You know, um, I've seen this baby take
as long as three days to make a match...

554
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,267
...so maybe you guys
wanna cross your fingers somewhere else.

555
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,356
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,
didn't you?

556
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,735
About catching this guy.
Yeah.

557
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,028
SOMERSET: Hmm.

558
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,782
Wish I still thought the way you do.

559
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:30,703
Why don't you tell me what the hell it is
you think we're doing then.

560
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,331
Picking up the pieces.

561
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:39,337
We're collecting all the evidence,
taking all the pictures and samples.

562
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,464
Writing everything down.

563
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,300
Noting the time things happened.

564
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:48,554
That's all?
That's all.

565
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:52,767
Putting everything into neat little piles
and filing it away.

566
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,896
On the off chance
it will ever be needed in the courtroom.

567
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,360
Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island.

568
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:06,072
Saving them in case we get rescued.

569
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,576
MILLS: Bullshit.

570
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:16,749
Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.

571
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:22,004
So many corpses roll away unrevenged.

572
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:28,177
Don't try to tell me
you didn't get that rush tonight.

573
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,596
I saw you.

574
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,266
We're getting somewhere.

575
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,157
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

576
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,618
You've got a winner.

577
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:02,086
This guy goes by the name of Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.

578
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,922
His prints were found
at the scene by Homicide.

579
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,551
He's got a long history
of serious mental illness.

580
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,888
His parents gave him
a very strict Southern Baptist upbringing.

581
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,724
But somewhere along the line,
they fell short.

582
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,768
Now, Victor dabbled in drugs,
armed robbery and assault.

583
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,606
Spent time in prison here a while back
for the attempted rape of a minor.

584
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,233
But his lawyer saw to it
that didn't last long.

585
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,986
His lawyer, by the way,
is the recently deceased Eli Gould.

586
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,738
Greed murder victim.
OFFICER: Yes, sir.

587
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,657
We're gonna finish this thing up today,
ladies and germs.

588
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:35,828
Victor's been out of circulation a while,
but there's still a residence in his name.

589
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,705
You're not buying all this, are you?

590
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,834
Doesn't seem like our guy, does it?
You tell me.

591
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,503
Our killer seems to have more purpose.

592
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,825
You ever take a bullet?

593
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,663
Never in my 34 years, knock wood.

594
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:24,168
I've only taken my gun out three times
with the intention of using it.

595
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,670
Never pulled the trigger.

596
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,797
Not once.

597
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,048
You?

598
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:35,388
Yeah, but, no, I never took a bullet,
but I pulled my gun once, shot it once.

599
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,598
Really?
It was my first one of these.

600
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,976
We were a secondary unit.

601
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,229
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie then.

602
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,691
Anyway, we bust open the door
looking for this junkie and, uh...

603
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,235
...the fucker just opened fire on us.

604
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,195
One cop got hit in the arm.

605
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,449
Christ, what was his name?

606
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,786
Spun him like a top.

607
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,038
You know,
I mean, more like slow motion.

608
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,583
I remember...

609
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,086
...riding in that ambulance.

610
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,214
Well, he died right there.

611
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,425
Right there.

612
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,927
Christ, what was his fucking name?

613
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,985
OFFICER 1: All rise.
OFFICER 2: Let's do it. Let's do it.

614
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,405
OFFICER 1: Go, go, go. Move.

615
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,617
Okay.

616
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,305
OFFICER 3: Get up there.

617
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,092
SWAT goes before dicks.

618
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,718
Hey.

619
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,097
They love this.

620
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,432
Police.

621
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:45,810
Clear.

622
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,522
Clear.
OFFICER: Clear.

623
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,898
Clear.

624
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,704
OFFICER 2: Clear.

625
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,464
Morning, sweetheart.

626
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,883
Get up now, motherfucker.

627
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,343
Now!

628
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,437
Get up, you sack of shit.

629
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,737
Oh, fuck me.

630
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:43,075
Dicks, you'll wanna
come take a look at this.

631
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,496
Dicks!

632
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,211
Oof.

633
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,421
Jesus.

634
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,631
Victor?
MILLS: What the hell?

635
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,049
Yeah, it's just Victor.

636
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,177
SOMERSET: Call an ambulance.
OFFICER: What is this?

637
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,596
CALIFORNIA: Hearse more like it.
SOMERSET: Also Forensics.

638
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,973
California, get your people out.
CALIFORNIA: Go on now.

639
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,600
No one touches anything.

640
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,935
It's some frigging wax sculpture
or something.

641
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,274
"Sloth."

642
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,076
MILLS: Oh, man.

643
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,037
Goddamn.

644
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,915
Those pictures were dated three days ago.

645
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,091
This must be the first one. Look.

646
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,428
It's dated exactly one year ago today.

647
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:52,478
I got a hair sample, I got a stool sample,
I got piss, I got fingernails.

648
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:58,567
He's laughing at us.
You got what you deserved.

649
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,072
He's alive, he's alive!

650
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,032
That cocksucker's alive!
SOMERSET: Guns down.

651
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,160
Still breathing!
Guns down! Emergency on that ambulance!

652
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,086
Coming through.

653
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,430
He's playing games.
No shit.

654
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:32,142
Look, we have to divorce ourselves
from emotion here.

655
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,352
Oh.

656
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,521
No matter how hard it is,
we have to remain focused.

657
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,856
Hey, man, I feed off my emotions.
How's that?

658
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,818
Are you listening to me?
Yes, I can hear you.

659
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,611
MAN: Excuse me.
What are you doing?

660
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,364
Closed crime scene, get out.
I got a right to be here.

661
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,907
UPI photographer.
Get out.

662
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,827
MAN: Hey, I got a fucking right to be here.
MILLS: Get out of here.

663
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,912
Get out. Jesus.
Fucking jerk. Fuck you.

664
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,706
I got your picture, man.
Oh, yeah?

665
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,332
MAN: I got your picture.
MILLS: Yeah?

666
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,544
Detective Mills, M-I-L-L-S, fuck off.

667
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,005
MAN: I'm surprised you can spell.
MILLS: Fuck you.

668
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:04,091
How do they get here so fucking quick?

669
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,635
They pay police for the information.

670
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:07,845
And they pay well.

671
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,681
Hey, man, I'm sorry, I...

672
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,516
Those, ugh...

673
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,394
You know, they piss me off.
It's okay.

674
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,063
It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.

675
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,072
A year of immobility seems about right...

676
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,159
...judging by the deterioration
of the muscles and the spine.

677
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,829
Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.

678
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,247
Even an antibiotic...

679
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:39,626
...which must've been administered
to keep the bed sores from infecting.

680
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:43,756
Now, has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way?

681
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,592
Even if his brain were not mush,
which it is...

682
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,636
...he chewed off
his own tongue long ago.

683
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,223
Uh, Doc.

684
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,269
Is there absolutely no chance
that he might survive?

685
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:03,067
Detective, he'd die of shock right now
if you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes.

686
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:06,779
He's experienced about as much pain
and suffering as anyone I've encountered.

687
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,781
Give or take.

688
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,242
And he still has hell to look forward to.

689
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,535
Good night.

690
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,539
MAN [ON RADIO]: Tonight we bring you
the Charlie Parker Quintet.

691
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,709
Featuring Sir Charles Thompson on piano,
Herb Pomeroy's trumpet...

692
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:25,422
...Jimmy Woode, bass, Kenny Clarke, drums,
and the alto saxophone of Charlie Parker.

693
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,133
Yeah?
TRACY [OVER PHONE]: Hello, William?

694
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:32,012
It's Tracy.
Tracy?

695
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,517
Is everything all right?
TRACY: Yeah, yes, everything's fine.

696
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,352
Where's David?
TRACY: He's just, uh...

697
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,896
He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.

698
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,982
Um, I'm sorry to call you like this.

699
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,026
Oh, it's all right. Um...

700
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,028
What can I do for you, Tracy?

701
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,156
I, uh...

702
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,659
Um, heh.

703
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,702
I need someone to talk to.

704
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:59,331
Do you think
you could meet me somewhere...

705
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,999
...maybe tomorrow morning?

706
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,336
I don't understand.

707
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:08,048
I feel stupid calling, but, uh...

708
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,511
...you're the only person
that I know here.

709
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,012
There's no one else.

710
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:18,642
If you can, just, uh, give me a call, okay?

711
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,811
I have to go now.

712
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,689
Well, good night.
Good night.

713
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:36,827
TRACY:
I mean, you know this city so well.

714
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:40,956
You've been here so long.

715
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,209
SOMERSET:
It can be a hard place.

716
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,045
I don't know why I asked you to come.

717
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,175
Why don't you talk to him about it?

718
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,010
Tell him how you feel.

719
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,055
I can't. You know, I can't be a burden.

720
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,308
Especially now.

721
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,061
I'll get used to things.

722
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,189
You know? I think I just...

723
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:09,651
I wanted to talk to someone
who's lived here for a long time and...

724
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:16,200
I mean, upstate, you know,
it's a completely different environment.

725
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,371
Did David tell you
that I teach fifth grade?

726
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,207
Well, I did.

727
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,002
Uh, he mentioned it.

728
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:33,592
I've been going around,
you know, looking at schools.

729
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:39,765
But the conditions here are horrible.

730
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,100
What about private schools?

731
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,231
I don't know.

732
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:51,443
Why don't you tell me
what's really bothering you, Tracy.

733
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,240
David and I are gonna have a baby.

734
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,704
Oh, Tracy, I...

735
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,707
I don't think I'm the, heh...

736
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,168
I'm the one to talk to about this.

737
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,587
I hate this city.

738
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,927
I had a relationship once.

739
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,304
It was very much like a marriage.

740
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,309
We got pregnant.

741
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,104
This was a long time ago.

742
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:36,321
I remember getting up one morning
and going to work.

743
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:42,869
Just another day like any other, except
it was the first day after I knew about...

744
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,080
...the pregnancy.

745
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:51,336
And I felt this fear for the first time ever.

746
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:57,759
I remember thinking how can I bring a child
into a world like this?

747
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:02,180
How can...? How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

748
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,107
I told her I didn't want to have it.

749
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,902
And over the next few weeks...

750
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,323
...I wore her down.

751
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,952
I wanna have children.

752
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,709
I can tell you now that...

753
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,378
I'm... I know, I mean...

754
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:39,509
I'm positive
that I made the right decision.

755
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,970
But there's not a day that passes...

756
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:46,600
...that I don't wish
that I had made a different choice.

757
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,314
If you don't keep...

758
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:57,235
The baby, I mean,
if that's your decision...

759
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,490
...don't ever tell him
that you were pregnant.

760
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:06,620
But if you choose to have this baby...

761
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:10,666
...you spoil that kid
every chance you get.

762
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:22,135
That's about all the advice
I can give you, Tracy.

763
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,769
I got to go.

764
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,604
William.

765
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,529
Thank you.

766
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:58,380
Victor's landlord said there was
an envelope of cash in the office mailbox...

767
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,632
...the first of every month.

768
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,555
Quote:

769
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:10,183
"I never heard a single complaint
from the tenant in Apartment 306.

770
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:12,978
And nobody ever complained about him.
Heh.

771
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,731
He's the best tenant I've ever had,"
end quote.

772
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,816
Yeah, a landlord's dream.

773
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,651
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.

774
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,445
Who pays the rent on time.

775
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:25,490
I'm sick of all this waiting.
This is the job.

776
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,285
Why aren't we out there, huh?

777
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:33,665
Why do we gotta sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic does it again?

778
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,710
It's dismissive to call him a lunatic.
Don't make that mistake.

779
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,504
Come on, he's insane. Look.

780
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:43,633
Right now he's probably dancing around
in his grandma's panties.

781
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:46,762
Yeah, rubbing himself in peanut butter.
Ooh.

782
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,056
How's that?
I don't think so.

783
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,560
His luck will run out.

784
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,396
Not depending on luck.

785
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:03,111
We walked into that apartment exactly
one year after he tied Victor to the bed.

786
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,197
One year to the day.

787
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,657
He wanted us to.
Don't know that for sure.

788
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,576
Oh, yes, we do.

789
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,287
This note he left.

790
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,164
His first words to us.

791
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,005
Fuck him. So what?

792
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,049
He's right, so far.

793
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:28,720
Imagine the will it takes
to keep a man bound for a full year.

794
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:32,724
To sever his hand
and use it to plant fingerprints.

795
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,685
To insert tubes into his genitals.

796
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:40,899
This guy is methodical, exacting,
and worst of all, patient.

797
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:43,026
He's a nut bag.

798
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:47,447
And just because the fucker's got
a library card doesn't make him Yoda.

799
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:55,121
How much money you got?
I got like 50. 50 bucks.

800
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:58,250
SOMERSET:
I propose a field trip. Come on.

801
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:02,587
We'll make a list.

802
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:05,590
At the top we'll put Purgatory,
Canterbury Tales.

803
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:08,385
Anything relating
to the seven deadly sins.

804
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,011
Ask yourself...
Hey, wait, wait.

805
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,931
...What would he study
to do the things he's done?

806
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,141
What are his interests now?

807
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,435
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

808
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,312
MILLS: Where are we going?
SOMERSET: Library.

809
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:35,495
Coupons, coupons, free coupons.

810
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:38,081
Discount... Discount coupons.

811
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:43,628
They must've had about 50
health violations during the last inspection.

812
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:48,466
Could you at least sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking we're dating.

813
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,635
Give me your money.

814
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:55,932
I'm giving you this, but for some reason,
I don't think I know what we're doing.

815
01:04:58,477 --> 01:04:59,978
Fuck.

816
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,023
GREASY: Hey, Somerset, how you doing?
Okay.

817
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:06,651
Didn't figure this was a mÃ©nage Ã  trois.
It's not a problem.

818
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,486
Sit down.

819
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:16,328
Only for you do I do this,
so it's a big risk.

820
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:18,997
So I figure we're just fair and square.

821
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,374
It's a deal.
All right.

822
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:27,088
About an hour.

823
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,134
Yeah, help yourself.

824
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,430
Well, that was money well spent.

825
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,682
Yeah.

826
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,650
All right.

827
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:50,028
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more
than I trust most people.

828
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,989
Well, good,
because I'm ready to punch you.

829
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:58,912
It's probably nothing,
but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.

830
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:04,501
The guy in the pizza parlor
is a friend from the Bureau.

831
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:07,629
Who, stinky man?

832
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:12,592
See, for years the FBI's been hooked
into the library system, keeping records.

833
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,097
Mm-hm. Assessing fines?
No, monitoring reading habits.

834
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:18,598
Look.
What?

835
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,642
Certain books are flagged.

836
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:25,397
Books on, say, nuclear weapons
and, well, Mein Kampf.

837
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:27,440
Anyone who checks out a flagged book...

838
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:30,568
...has his library records fed
into the FBI's computers then on.

839
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:32,737
Wait, wait, wait, how is this legal?

840
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:35,740
Oh, legal, illegal.
These terms don't apply.

841
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,075
Oh.
You...

842
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:41,413
You can't use the information directly.
It's just a useful guide.

843
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,249
It might sound silly,
but you can't get a library card...

844
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,418
...without, uh, an ID
and a current phone bill, see?

845
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,924
So they run a list.
Precisely.

846
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:56,469
If you wanna know who's reading
Purgatory and Paradise Lost...

847
01:06:56,637 --> 01:07:01,641
...and Helter Skelter,
the FBI's computers will tell us.

848
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,768
It could give us a name.
It could.

849
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:07,772
Could get a name of some college kid
writing a term paper on 20th-century crime.

850
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:10,775
At least you're out of the office.

851
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,652
Get a haircut.

852
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:15,530
How do you know all this?
I don't.

853
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,825
Neither do you.
Exactly.

854
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:30,879
"The Divine Comedy.
History of Catholicism."

855
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,214
There's a book called
Murderers and Madmen.

856
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:37,177
"Modern Homicide Investigation,
In Cold Blood.

857
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,345
Of Human Bondage." Bondage?

858
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,806
Not what you think.
Okay.

859
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:44,142
"The Marquis de Sade."

860
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,144
It's the Marquis de Sade.
Whatever.

861
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,688
"The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqua... "
Something.

862
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,107
Saint Thomas Aquinas. There it is.

863
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:54,110
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

864
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:56,863
Is that it?
Yeah.

865
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,325
Let's try it.
Jonathan Doe?

866
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,576
Whatever.

867
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,328
SOMERSET:
We're sure about that name?

868
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,496
MILLS: Yeah.

869
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:07,207
You saw it, John Doe.

870
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:09,793
You wanna go back, I'll go back.

871
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,212
Let's take a look at him. Talk to him.

872
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,506
MILLS: This is crazy.

873
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:17,467
Ah, we'll just talk to him.
Uh-huh.

874
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:21,054
"Excuse me, sir.
Are you by any chance a serial killer?"

875
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,057
Okay.

876
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,101
You do the talking.

877
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,062
Put that silver tongue of yours to work.
No.

878
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,481
You been talking to my wife?

879
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,653
This is retarded.

880
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,613
Charlie's Fucking Angels.

881
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,783
A name off a computer.

882
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,704
Mills.

883
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,630
Fuck.

884
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:59,551
You hit?
No.

885
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,639
MILLS:
He's going down, he's going down!

886
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:22,157
Fifth floor.

887
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,783
Mills.

888
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,412
GIRL: Mommy?

889
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,414
Mommy?

890
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,721
Police. Is there a back way out?

891
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:46,264
Lock your door.

892
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,978
MAN: What the hell is going on, man?
Get out of the fucking hall, please.

893
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,880
Get down.
Aah!

894
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,131
Hey.

895
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:22,008
Get the fuck down.

896
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,205
Aah!

897
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,252
Shit.

898
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,172
MAN: Get the fuck out of there.

899
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:16,688
MAN: Hey! Shut the fuck up!

900
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,315
Goddamn it.

901
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:12,201
Fuck.

902
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,671
MILLS:
Get out of the fucking way! Move!

903
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:08,025
Mills?

904
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:10,695
No.

905
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:32,425
Mills.

906
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,889
Mills, you okay?
I'm all right.

907
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:41,726
I'm all right.

908
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:47,440
SOMERSET: Where are you going?
I'm going in.

909
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:50,026
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

910
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,028
Wait.
What are you talking about?

911
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:53,571
He shot at us.
You can't.

912
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,531
The hell we can't.
We need a warrant.

913
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:57,408
We got probable cause. Come on.

914
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:58,743
Think about it, think.

915
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,411
How did we get here?
Huh?

916
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:03,789
I can't tell anyone this, I can't tell anyone.
Oh, come on, out of the way.

917
01:15:03,957 --> 01:15:05,833
We have no reason to be here.

918
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,460
Will you listen to me?
Get off.

919
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:09,795
Listen to me, listen.
Get the fuck off me.

920
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:11,589
All right, all right, I'm sorry.

921
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,258
But would you
just pay attention a minute?

922
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:17,720
If we leave a hole like this,
we won't be able to prosecute.

923
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,556
The fucking guy will walk.
Now, is that what you want?

924
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:23,518
By the time we clear a warrant, someone else
No, fuck that.

925
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:28,022
We need a reason to knock on this door.
No, no.

926
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,316
Think about it.

927
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:33,152
Okay?

928
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,281
Okay, man. Okay.

929
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:39,992
You're right. I'm all fucked up.

930
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,119
When you're right, you're right.

931
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:54,215
Well, no point in arguing anymore.

932
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,801
Unless you can fix that.

933
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,847
You stupid son of a...

934
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:11,732
How much money we got left?

935
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:16,237
So, yeah,
like, I noticed this guy going out a lot.

936
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,323
When the murders was happening,
so I, um...

937
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:21,826
So...
So you called Detective Somerset, right?

938
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:26,122
Yeah, right, right, so I called the detective,
because this guy was creepy and shit.

939
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:29,000
And one of the murders,
it happened right over there.

940
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:31,794
Okay. I told you the rest. You got it?
Called the cops.

941
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:33,004
Good?
Got your story.

942
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:34,880
Have her sign. You gotta sign.
Okay.

943
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:37,300
Okay? Good, good, good.

944
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:40,177
All right.
You did good.

945
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:42,638
WOMAN: I did what you said.
MILLS: Here you go.

946
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:45,349
You get something to eat, all right?
You eat.

947
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,563
SOMERSET:
Everybody, stay outside.

948
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:53,459
Victor.

949
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:08,719
Somerset!

950
01:20:09,846 --> 01:20:13,224
Somerset!
Yeah?

951
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,313
What?
We had him.

952
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:21,273
What are you talking about?

953
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:24,902
The fucking photographer
in the fucking stairs.

954
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:31,867
We had him and we let him go.

955
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,792
You're sure this is him?

956
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,252
Yup, good, good. Yup.

957
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:43,087
Yeah, good, get it out.
SARA: All right.

958
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:46,423
Uh, we've got nothing, no pay stubs,
no appointment books, no addresses.

959
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:48,425
This is the best, this receipt.
Keep looking.

960
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:50,553
Let me show you something.
This was under the bed.

961
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,680
Uh, his only source of funds.

962
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,182
No kidding, we got his money.
Fucking A, I like it.

963
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,433
SARA: One thing.
MILLS: Yes?

964
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:59,562
You're probably not gonna believe this.
We haven't found a fingerprint yet.

965
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:03,732
Um, not a single one.
You're right, I don't. Keep looking.

966
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:09,989
We could use some more men here.

967
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:13,576
Hey, man, I'm doing the best I can.
What are you getting with all this?

968
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:15,744
There are 2000 notebooks
on these shelves.

969
01:21:15,912 --> 01:21:18,789
And each notebook contains
about 250 pages.

970
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,584
Forget it. Anything about the killings?

971
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:26,213
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are,
and what a gross stage we dance on.

972
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:30,301
What fun we have dancing and fucking.
Not a care in the world.

973
01:21:30,468 --> 01:21:32,136
Not knowing that we are nothing.

974
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,555
We are not what was intended."

975
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:37,141
No, wait, there's a lot more.

976
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:41,478
"On the subway today, a man came up
to me to start a conversation.

977
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:46,150
He made small talk, a lonely man,
talking about the weather and things.

978
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,444
I tried to be pleasant and accommodating.

979
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:51,405
But my head began to hurt
from his banality.

980
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:56,535
I almost didn't notice it had happened,
but I suddenly threw up all over him.

981
01:21:56,828 --> 01:22:01,624
He was not pleased.
And I couldn't stop laughing."

982
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:03,959
No dates.

983
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:07,463
Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.

984
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:11,467
Just his mind poured out on paper.

985
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,010
Looks like a life's work.

986
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,555
If we had 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts,
it'd still take two months.

987
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:18,474
I know, I know, I know.

988
01:22:22,562 --> 01:22:23,812
MAN: Where's that phone?

989
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:28,776
Phone? Phone?

990
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,027
Phone?

991
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,949
People, quiet.

992
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:52,716
Hello?
JOHN [OVER PHONE]: I admire you.

993
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:57,137
I don't know how you found me,
but imagine my surprise.

994
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:01,016
I respect you law enforcement agents
more every day.

995
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:04,228
Well, I appreciate that, John.

996
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,105
I tell you...
JOHN: No, listen, all right?

997
01:23:06,272 --> 01:23:10,359
I'll be re-adjusting my schedule
in light of today's little setback.

998
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:12,945
I just had to call
and express my admiration.

999
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:15,948
Sorry I had to hurt one of you...

1000
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:18,742
...but I didn't really have a choice, did I?
Hmm.

1001
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,619
JOHN:
You will accept my apology, won't you?

1002
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:23,205
I feel like saying more,
but I don't wanna ruin the surprise.

1003
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:31,005
JOHN [ON RECORDER]: adjusting my
schedule after today's little setback.

1004
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:32,506
Got it.

1005
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:38,762
All right, everybody, back to work.

1006
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:42,182
You were right.
SOMERSET: Hmm?

1007
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:45,936
Ugh, he's preaching.
Yeah.

1008
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,564
These murders are his sermons to us.

1009
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:52,276
Look, we know him,
we know him, we know him.

1010
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:56,822
Who's the blonde?

1011
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,453
Looks like a pro.

1012
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,038
Maybe.

1013
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:06,540
She caught John Doe's eye.

1014
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:14,339
BILL:
Yeah, he came and collected it last night.

1015
01:24:14,507 --> 01:24:16,008
MILLS: Last night?
BILL: Yeah.

1016
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:17,634
This man?
Yeah, John Doe.

1017
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:20,012
It's an easy name to remember.
He had a limp.

1018
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,807
What was this job you did for him?
I've got a picture of it. Hang on.

1019
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:26,143
One sweet piece, actually.

1020
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,646
I thought he was one of them
performance artists, that's what I thought.

1021
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:35,569
You know, the sort of guy that pisses
in a cup on stage and, uh, then drinks it.

1022
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,113
Performance art.
Hmm.

1023
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:43,202
I think I undercharged him, actually.

1024
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:44,620
You made this for him?

1025
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:47,498
Yeah, I've made weirder shit
than that. So what?

1026
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,214
They found the blonde.

1027
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,886
The picture.

1028
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:03,931
Fucking pigs.

1029
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:08,852
OFFICER: We need you to move, pal.
MAN: I'll come out, but you guys...

1030
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:12,356
OFFICER: Get the fuck out of the booth.
I've been in this cage the whole time.

1031
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,733
Okay?
I'm not fucking with you.

1032
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:16,652
Come on, this way.

1033
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,160
Can you do something
about this music?

1034
01:25:25,328 --> 01:25:27,955
Yeah, we're working on it.
We're looking for the guy.

1035
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:42,386
You from Homicide? You...

1036
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,513
You better see this.
Yeah. All right.

1037
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,767
OFFICER: Hey, easy. Got him?

1038
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:53,230
MAN: Get this thing off of me.

1039
01:25:53,606 --> 01:25:55,440
Oh, God, get this thing off of me!

1040
01:25:56,067 --> 01:25:57,651
Get this thing off of me!

1041
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,820
Get this off!
MILLS: Get him out of here, now.

1042
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,446
Get him out of here, now!

1043
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:04,992
MILLS:
Come on, I wanna hear it again.

1044
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,412
Tell me again.
MAN: Just... I don't know.

1045
01:26:08,788 --> 01:26:11,915
You heard nothing strange,
you saw nothing strange.

1046
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:14,084
No.
MILLS: No.

1047
01:26:15,795 --> 01:26:17,462
He asked me if I was married.

1048
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:20,674
And I could see he had a gun in his hand.
Where was the girl?

1049
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,135
The what? What?

1050
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:25,762
The girl, the prostitute. Where was she?

1051
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,432
Someone comes to your establishment.

1052
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,435
They want to go downstairs
and wanna get a little ooh la la.

1053
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,103
Whatever.

1054
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:36,648
They got to come to you, yeah?
Yeah.

1055
01:26:36,816 --> 01:26:38,192
You didn't see anyone?

1056
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:42,571
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?

1057
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:46,992
Hey, everybody that comes in there's
got a package under their arms.

1058
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:50,537
Some guys are carrying suitcases
full of stuff.

1059
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:53,332
[SHUDDERING]
She was just sitting on the bed.

1060
01:26:59,797 --> 01:27:02,132
Who tied her down? You or him?

1061
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,927
Do you like what you do for a living?

1062
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:08,013
These things you see?
No.

1063
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,807
No, I don't.

1064
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:14,978
But that's life, isn't it?

1065
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:24,321
He had a gun and he made it happen.

1066
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:27,866
He made me do it.

1067
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:31,536
He put that thing on me.

1068
01:27:31,704 --> 01:27:34,331
And he made me wear it.

1069
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:38,502
Then he told me to fuck her.

1070
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,172
And I did. I fucked her.

1071
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:44,424
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1072
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:46,593
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.

1073
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:50,389
The fucking gun was in my throat.

1074
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,015
Fuck.

1075
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:56,603
Oh, God, God.

1076
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,648
God, help me. Please, please, help me.

1077
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:01,525
Please, please, help me.

1078
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:21,586
You know,
this isn't gonna have a happy ending.

1079
01:28:21,754 --> 01:28:25,173
It's not possible.
Hey, if we catch him, I'll be happy enough.

1080
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:30,095
If we catch John Doe
and he turns out to be the devil

1081
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:34,057
I mean, if he's Satan himself,
that might live up to our expectations...

1082
01:28:34,225 --> 01:28:37,102
...but he's not the devil.

1083
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,230
He's just a man.

1084
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:42,733
You know...

1085
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,736
...see, you bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things. These:

1086
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:51,491
If you think you're preparing me
for hard times, thank you, but...

1087
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,828
But you gotta be a hero.

1088
01:28:55,621 --> 01:28:58,915
You wanna be a champion. Let me
tell you, people don't want a champion.

1089
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:01,585
They wanna eat cheeseburgers,
play lotto and watch TV.

1090
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:03,503
How did you get like this?

1091
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:06,882
I wanna know.
Ah.

1092
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:12,429
It wasn't one thing, I can tell you that.

1093
01:29:13,973 --> 01:29:15,265
Go on.

1094
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:22,939
I just don't think I can continue to live in a
place that embraces and nurtures apathy...

1095
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:25,359
...as if it was a virtue.

1096
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:27,444
You're no different, no better.

1097
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:30,405
I didn't say I was different or better.
I'm not.

1098
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:33,617
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.

1099
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:36,119
Apathy is a solution.

1100
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:40,916
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself in drugs
than it is to cope with life.

1101
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:43,126
Yeah.
It's easier to steal what you want...

1102
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:44,795
...than it is to earn it.
Yeah.

1103
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:47,297
It's easier to beat a child
than it is to raise it.

1104
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:50,258
Hell, love costs. It takes effort and work.

1105
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:52,969
We are talking
about people who are mentally ill.

1106
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:55,847
We are talking
about people, fucking crazies.

1107
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:57,474
No. No, we're not.
Yes, today.

1108
01:29:57,642 --> 01:30:00,894
We're talking about everyday life here.

1109
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:04,648
You can't afford to be this naive.

1110
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:06,400
Fuck off.

1111
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:10,821
See, you should listen to yourself. Yeah.

1112
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:14,658
You say that the problem
with people is that they don't care.

1113
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,494
So I don't care about people.

1114
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:19,371
It makes no sense. You know why?

1115
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,832
Uh, you care?
You wanna know...?

1116
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:24,501
Damn right.
And you're gonna make a difference?

1117
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:28,964
Whatever, the point is,
is that I don't think you're quitting...

1118
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:32,342
...because you believe these things
you say. I don't.

1119
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:36,012
I think you wanna believe them
because you're quitting.

1120
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:41,101
You want me to agree and say,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

1121
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:43,228
It's all fucked up. It's a fucking mess.

1122
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:46,815
We should all go live
in a fucking log cabin."

1123
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,192
But I won't.

1124
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,486
I won't say that.

1125
01:30:52,321 --> 01:30:55,740
I don't agree with you. I do not.

1126
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:00,912
I can't.

1127
01:31:10,339 --> 01:31:12,174
I'm gonna go home.

1128
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,558
Thank you, though.

1129
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:53,590
I love you, honey.

1130
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:59,429
So much.

1131
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:05,477
TRACY: I know.

1132
01:33:07,498 --> 01:33:10,000
MAN: 911, what's your emergency?

1133
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:11,876
Could you repeat that?

1134
01:33:12,044 --> 01:33:15,505
JOHN [OVER PHONE]:
I've gone and done it again.

1135
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:26,766
What have we got?

1136
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,352
Uh, sleeping pills.

1137
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:31,688
Glued to one hand.

1138
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:33,398
Telephone glued to the other.

1139
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:36,359
You see what he did?

1140
01:33:37,486 --> 01:33:38,862
He sliced her up.

1141
01:33:39,488 --> 01:33:40,947
Then he bandaged her.

1142
01:33:41,532 --> 01:33:43,533
Call for help and you'll live.

1143
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:45,994
But you'll be disfigured.

1144
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:49,914
Or you can put yourself
out of your own misery.

1145
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,042
Come on.

1146
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:53,543
Cut off her nose.

1147
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:55,378
To spite her face.

1148
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:58,214
And he did it very recently.

1149
01:34:05,264 --> 01:34:06,723
SOMERSET: Listen.

1150
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:12,395
I've decided to stay on till this is done.
I figure one of two things will happen.

1151
01:34:12,563 --> 01:34:17,192
We'll get John Doe or he'll finish his series
of seven and this case will go on for years.

1152
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,570
MILLS: Hey man, you don't have to do me
any favors. Thank you, but I got it.

1153
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:24,074
SOMERSET: I'm requesting that you keep
me on as your partner for a few more days.

1154
01:34:24,241 --> 01:34:26,159
You'd be doing me a favor.

1155
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:38,380
MILLS: You knew I'd say yes.

1156
01:34:38,547 --> 01:34:40,006
Hey, we're here.
SERGEANT: Wonderful.

1157
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:43,635
Your wife called.
Get yourself an answering machine.

1158
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:47,472
JOHN: Detective?

1159
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:50,934
After this, I'm gone.

1160
01:34:51,435 --> 01:34:53,937
No big surprise.
JOHN: Detective!

1161
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:58,316
You're looking for me.

1162
01:34:58,776 --> 01:34:59,776
Hey!

1163
01:35:01,153 --> 01:35:03,613
Don't you fucking move.
On the fucking floor.

1164
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:05,073
Keep away from him!

1165
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:06,950
MILLS: On the fucking floor.
I know you.

1166
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:08,493
Now. Get down.

1167
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:11,913
Get down on your stomach,
you piece of shit.

1168
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:13,957
Now. All the way!

1169
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,292
All the way, fucker! Down!

1170
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:19,003
Faster. Faster. Faster, fucker.

1171
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:22,424
Now. Nose on the ground.

1172
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:28,054
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?

1173
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:31,391
I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please.

1174
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:35,019
Goddamn it.

1175
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:38,982
CAPTAIN: He cuts the skin off the tips
of his fingers.

1176
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:43,403
That's why we couldn't find one single
usable print in his apartment.

1177
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,905
Looks like he's been doing it
for a quite sometime.

1178
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:48,491
What about the bank accounts? The guns?

1179
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:50,493
CAPTAIN:
So far everything's a dead end.

1180
01:35:50,661 --> 01:35:53,413
No credit history. No employment records.

1181
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:57,333
His bank account's only 5 years old
and it was started with cash.

1182
01:35:57,501 --> 01:35:59,377
We're even trying to trace his furniture.

1183
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:01,963
About only thing we know about that guy
right now...

1184
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:06,968
...is that he's independently wealthy,
well-educated and totally insane.

1185
01:36:07,136 --> 01:36:09,137
Because he's John Doe by choice.

1186
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:11,848
Okay, so when do we get to question him?
CAPTAIN: You don't.

1187
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:13,850
He going to court now.
MILLS: What?

1188
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:16,478
I'm telling you,
there's no way he'd turn himself in.

1189
01:36:16,645 --> 01:36:18,271
It doesn't make any sense.

1190
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:22,025
Well, there he sits.
It's not supposed to make any sense.

1191
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:24,861
He's not finished.
No, he's pissing in our faces.

1192
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:29,282
We're just taking it like idiots.
You know what I'm talking about.

1193
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:33,369
For the first time ever,
you and I are in total agreement.

1194
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:37,040
He wouldn't just stop.
MILLS: Ugh, so, what the fuck, man?

1195
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,418
SOMERSET: He's two murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1196
01:36:41,837 --> 01:36:43,922
We'll wait for his plea.

1197
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:51,638
My client says there are two more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1198
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:54,599
He will take Detectives Mills
and Somerset to these bodies...

1199
01:36:54,767 --> 01:36:58,937
...but only Detective Mills and Somerset,
only at 6:00 today.

1200
01:36:59,104 --> 01:37:00,688
Why us?

1201
01:37:00,856 --> 01:37:02,315
He says he admires you.

1202
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:05,401
It's part of the game.

1203
01:37:05,569 --> 01:37:08,321
The client claims
if the detectives do not accept this...

1204
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:12,408
...these bodies will never be found.
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.

1205
01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:13,827
Hey.

1206
01:37:13,994 --> 01:37:15,245
We've got him.

1207
01:37:15,412 --> 01:37:17,622
Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.

1208
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:20,834
He's gonna get his free room and board,
get his free cable TV.

1209
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:24,462
Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we having this conversation?

1210
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:27,090
Mills.
No. Hey, something stinks.

1211
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:28,424
And this one here...

1212
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:32,262
Yeah, you, in your $3000 suit
and that smug smile on your face...

1213
01:37:32,429 --> 01:37:35,014
...dealing for that shit, I don't like it...
Mills.

1214
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:37,433
I am required by law to serve my clients...

1215
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:39,352
...to the best of my ability.
Aw, Jesus.

1216
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,981
To serve their best interest.
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.

1217
01:37:43,148 --> 01:37:45,567
My client wishes inform you
if you do not accept...

1218
01:37:45,734 --> 01:37:48,361
...he will plead insanity across the board.

1219
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,196
TALBOT: Let him try it.

1220
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:51,489
I'd like to see him try.

1221
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:54,659
Come on, now, we all know
the extreme nature of these crimes...

1222
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:57,245
...I could get him off with such a plea.

1223
01:37:57,413 --> 01:38:00,123
I'm not letting this conviction slide.
I can tell you that.

1224
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:03,918
He says that if you do accept
under his specific conditions...

1225
01:38:04,086 --> 01:38:06,713
...he'll sign a full confession,
plead guilty right now.

1226
01:38:07,089 --> 01:38:09,299
It's your case. Make a decision.

1227
01:38:11,093 --> 01:38:12,719
Full confession.

1228
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,680
I'm in.
It has to be the both of you.

1229
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:22,604
If he were to claim insanity,
this conversation is admissible.

1230
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:25,023
The fact that he's blackmailing us
with his plea.

1231
01:38:25,190 --> 01:38:27,817
And my client would like to remind you
two more are dead.

1232
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,485
Press would have a field day...

1233
01:38:29,653 --> 01:38:32,614
...if they find out the police didn't seem
concerned about them.

1234
01:38:32,781 --> 01:38:35,992
Giving them a proper burial.
If in fact there are two more dead.

1235
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:40,330
Lab report came up from downtown. They
did a quickie on Doe's clothing and nails.

1236
01:38:40,497 --> 01:38:44,000
They found blood from Doe.
From him slicing his fingers.

1237
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,794
Blood from the woman
who's face he cut off.

1238
01:38:46,962 --> 01:38:51,674
And blood from a third party,
as yet unidentified.

1239
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:56,971
You'd be escorting an unarmed man.

1240
01:39:00,017 --> 01:39:01,476
Let's finish it.

1241
01:39:05,105 --> 01:39:08,107
SOMERSET: If John Doe's head splits open
and a UFO should fly out...

1242
01:39:08,525 --> 01:39:11,027
...I want you to have expected it.

1243
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:14,364
I will.

1244
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:18,910
Hey, man, if I was
to accidentally shave off a nipple...

1245
01:39:19,078 --> 01:39:20,703
...would it be covered
by workman's comp?

1246
01:39:20,871 --> 01:39:21,871
Hmm.

1247
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:28,169
I suppose so.

1248
01:39:28,879 --> 01:39:30,380
Yeah.
If you were man enough...

1249
01:39:30,547 --> 01:39:34,759
...to actually file a claim,
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.

1250
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:38,972
If I keep coming home late,
my wife's gonna think something's up.

1251
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:49,565
You know...

1252
01:39:50,734 --> 01:39:52,026
Yeah.

1253
01:39:57,866 --> 01:39:59,158
What?

1254
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:11,981
Let's go.

1255
01:41:42,429 --> 01:41:44,847
PILOT [OVER RADIO]:
C-Victor-5-5 take. Clear the TC.

1256
01:41:45,015 --> 01:41:46,265
Pull around.

1257
01:41:47,684 --> 01:41:50,770
There it is.
Late-model black sedan at your 10 o'clock.

1258
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,197
Who are you, John?

1259
01:42:02,282 --> 01:42:04,075
Who are you really?

1260
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:05,451
What do you mean?

1261
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:09,372
At this stage, what harm can it do
to tell us a bit about yourself?

1262
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:13,042
It doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.

1263
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:15,128
You need to stay on your left up here.

1264
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:21,092
So where are we heading?

1265
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:22,802
You'll see.

1266
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:27,056
We're not just going to pick up
two more dead bodies, are we, John?

1267
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:29,433
That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1268
01:42:29,601 --> 01:42:32,728
We've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1269
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:36,023
Wanting people to listen...

1270
01:42:36,191 --> 01:42:39,735
...you can't just tap them
on the shoulder anymore.

1271
01:42:39,903 --> 01:42:42,280
You have to hit them
with a sledgehammer.

1272
01:42:42,447 --> 01:42:45,408
And then you'll notice
you've got their strict attention.

1273
01:42:45,576 --> 01:42:47,451
MILLS: But the question is:

1274
01:42:47,619 --> 01:42:50,288
What makes you so special
that people should listen?

1275
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:51,956
I'm not special.

1276
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:55,585
JOHN [ON RADIO]:
I've never been exceptional.

1277
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:59,589
This is, though, what I'm doing.
My work.

1278
01:43:00,048 --> 01:43:01,340
Your work, John?

1279
01:43:01,925 --> 01:43:03,050
Yes.

1280
01:43:03,218 --> 01:43:06,179
See, I don't...
I don't see anything special about it, John.

1281
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:08,639
That's not true.

1282
01:43:08,807 --> 01:43:09,891
No, it is true.

1283
01:43:10,058 --> 01:43:13,227
And the funny thing is, all this work...

1284
01:43:13,395 --> 01:43:15,396
...two months from now,
no one's gonna care.

1285
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:17,899
No one's gonna give a shit,
no one's gonna remember.

1286
01:43:18,066 --> 01:43:21,110
You can't see the whole complete
act yet.

1287
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,446
But when this is done...

1288
01:43:24,781 --> 01:43:26,115
...when it's finished...

1289
01:43:27,951 --> 01:43:29,452
...it's going to be...

1290
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:35,791
People will barely be able
to comprehend.

1291
01:43:35,959 --> 01:43:38,002
But they won't be able to deny.

1292
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,088
Could the freak be more vague?

1293
01:43:42,257 --> 01:43:44,508
I mean, as far as master plans go, John...

1294
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:48,512
I can't wait for you to see. I really can't.
It's really going to be something.

1295
01:43:49,598 --> 01:43:52,308
Well, you know what?
I'm gonna be standing next to you.

1296
01:43:52,476 --> 01:43:55,728
So when this big thing happens,
you be sure and let me know.

1297
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:59,398
Because I wouldn't wanna miss it.
JOHN: Oh, don't worry.

1298
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:00,608
You won't.

1299
01:44:02,611 --> 01:44:04,737
You won't miss a thing.

1300
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:14,622
PILOT: With the tour bus itself,
give two miles separation.

1301
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:32,723
What's so exciting?

1302
01:44:33,934 --> 01:44:35,851
It's not too far now.

1303
01:44:39,564 --> 01:44:41,315
PILOT: High-tension lines ahead.

1304
01:44:41,483 --> 01:44:42,650
Prepare for frequency change.

1305
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:45,569
I've been trying to figure something
in my head.

1306
01:44:45,737 --> 01:44:48,114
And maybe you can help me out, yeah?

1307
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:53,703
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are...

1308
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:56,205
...do you know that you're insane?

1309
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:58,791
Maybe you're sitting around,
reading Guns and Ammo...

1310
01:44:58,959 --> 01:45:02,211
...masturbating in your own feces,
do you just stop and go:

1311
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:05,881
"Wow, it is amazing how fucking crazy
I really am"?

1312
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:08,551
Yeah? Do you guys do that?

1313
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:12,054
It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.

1314
01:45:12,222 --> 01:45:13,431
It's very comfortable.

1315
01:45:14,224 --> 01:45:17,560
It's not something I would expect
you to accept.

1316
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:20,730
But I did not choose. I was chosen.

1317
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:24,775
MILLS: Well, whatever.
I don't doubt that you believe that, John.

1318
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:29,405
But seems to me that you're overlooking
a glaring contradiction.

1319
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:30,823
Meaning what?

1320
01:45:32,034 --> 01:45:33,951
Glad you asked.

1321
01:45:35,287 --> 01:45:36,912
If you were chosen...

1322
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:40,916
...that is, by a higher power...

1323
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:43,502
...and if your hand was forced...

1324
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:47,173
...it seems strange to me
that you'd get such enjoyment out of it.

1325
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:50,718
You enjoyed torturing those people.

1326
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:54,930
This doesn't seem in keeping
with martyrdom, does it?

1327
01:45:56,099 --> 01:45:57,308
John?

1328
01:46:02,147 --> 01:46:05,024
I doubt I enjoyed it
any more than Detective Mills...

1329
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:08,903
...would enjoy time alone with me
in a room without windows.

1330
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:11,280
Isn't that true?

1331
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:14,533
How happy would it make you
to hurt me with impunity.

1332
01:46:14,701 --> 01:46:15,785
That hurts my feelings.

1333
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:20,539
I would never...
You wouldn't because there's consequences.

1334
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:24,668
It's in those eyes of yours, though.

1335
01:46:24,836 --> 01:46:27,505
Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

1336
01:46:28,256 --> 01:46:33,177
I won't deny my own personal desire
to turn each sin against the sinner.

1337
01:46:34,179 --> 01:46:37,431
Wait a minute, I thought all you did
was kill innocent people.

1338
01:46:39,434 --> 01:46:42,019
Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny?

1339
01:46:42,896 --> 01:46:44,355
An obese man.

1340
01:46:44,523 --> 01:46:47,024
A disgusting man
who could barely stand up.

1341
01:46:47,192 --> 01:46:51,487
If you saw him, you'd point him out to your
friends so they'd join you in mocking him.

1342
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:53,948
A man, who if you saw him
while you were eating...

1343
01:46:54,116 --> 01:46:56,659
...you wouldn't be able
to finish your meal.

1344
01:46:56,952 --> 01:47:00,496
And after him, lawyer. You must've
secretly been thanking me for that one.

1345
01:47:00,997 --> 01:47:03,916
This is a man who dedicated his life...

1346
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:08,712
...to making money by lying
with every breath that he could muster...

1347
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,757
...to keeping murderers and rapists
on the streets.

1348
01:47:11,925 --> 01:47:13,342
Murderers?
A woman.

1349
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:15,594
Murderers, John, like yourself?
A woman...

1350
01:47:15,762 --> 01:47:18,472
...so ugly inside that she
couldn't bear to go on living...

1351
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:20,933
...if she couldn't be beautiful
on the outside?

1352
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:25,521
A drug dealer.
A drug dealing pederast, actually.

1353
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:28,357
And let's not forget
the disease-spreading whore.

1354
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:33,028
Only in a world this shitty...

1355
01:47:33,196 --> 01:47:36,907
...could you try to say these were
innocent people and keep a straight face.

1356
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:41,996
But that's the point.

1357
01:47:43,165 --> 01:47:46,208
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner...

1358
01:47:46,376 --> 01:47:49,253
...in every home and we tolerate it.

1359
01:47:49,921 --> 01:47:52,673
We tolerate it
because it's common, it's...

1360
01:47:52,841 --> 01:47:54,508
It's trivial.

1361
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:57,636
We tolerate it morning, noon and night.

1362
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:02,892
Well, not anymore.

1363
01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:07,271
I'm setting the example.

1364
01:48:08,273 --> 01:48:09,982
And what I've done is gonna be...

1365
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:11,901
...puzzled over...

1366
01:48:12,068 --> 01:48:13,903
...and studied...

1367
01:48:14,696 --> 01:48:16,405
...and followed...

1368
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:18,949
...forever.

1369
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:21,535
Yeah.

1370
01:48:22,412 --> 01:48:24,747
Delusions of grandeur.

1371
01:48:25,624 --> 01:48:27,416
You should be thanking me.

1372
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:29,126
Why's that, John?

1373
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:32,421
Because you're going
to be remembered after this.

1374
01:48:32,589 --> 01:48:36,425
Realize, detective, the only reason
that I'm here right now...

1375
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:38,636
...is that I wanted to be.

1376
01:48:38,803 --> 01:48:41,305
No. No, we would've got you eventually.

1377
01:48:41,473 --> 01:48:42,765
Oh, really?

1378
01:48:42,933 --> 01:48:47,186
So, what were you doing, biding your time?
Toying with me?

1379
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:53,192
Allowing five innocent people to die
until you felt like springing your trap?

1380
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:57,446
Tell me, what was the indisputable evidence
you were going to use on me...

1381
01:48:57,614 --> 01:49:02,076
...right before I walked up to you
and put my hands in the air?

1382
01:49:02,244 --> 01:49:04,453
John, calm down.

1383
01:49:04,621 --> 01:49:06,997
I seem to remember us
knocking on your door.

1384
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:09,166
Oh, that's right.

1385
01:49:09,334 --> 01:49:12,670
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

1386
01:49:17,425 --> 01:49:20,261
You're only alive because I didn't kill you.

1387
01:49:20,428 --> 01:49:22,388
Okay, sit back.
I spared you.

1388
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:23,597
Sit back.

1389
01:49:23,765 --> 01:49:26,058
Remember that every time
you look in the mirror...

1390
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:28,936
...at that face of yours
for the rest of your life...

1391
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:30,771
...or should I say for the rest...

1392
01:49:30,939 --> 01:49:33,315
...of what life I allow you to have.
MILLS: Sit back.

1393
01:49:33,483 --> 01:49:37,069
Sit back, you fucking freak.
Shut your fucking mouth.

1394
01:49:38,697 --> 01:49:41,448
You're no messiah.
You're a movie of the week.

1395
01:49:41,616 --> 01:49:45,202
You're a fucking T-shirt at best.

1396
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,551
Don't ask me to pity those people.

1397
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:02,136
I don't mourn them any more...

1398
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:04,847
...than the thousands that died
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

1399
01:50:05,181 --> 01:50:09,643
Is that to say, John, that what you
were doing was God's good work?

1400
01:50:12,897 --> 01:50:16,191
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1401
01:50:18,111 --> 01:50:20,237
Do you see those high-tension towers?

1402
01:50:20,697 --> 01:50:23,032
JOHN: That's where we're headed.
PILOT: I see where.

1403
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:25,534
Right to your 9 o'clock
and follow that access road.

1404
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:34,043
MAN:
Your signal's breaking up, Viking.

1405
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:37,671
PILOT: Un-fucking-avoidable, Center.
We're in power-line city, deal with it.

1406
01:50:39,174 --> 01:50:42,009
This sure as shit is no ambush out here.

1407
01:50:42,177 --> 01:50:44,928
No fucking nothing out here.
Can't land anywhere near.

1408
01:50:45,096 --> 01:50:47,931
They're gonna be coming up
behind us in about two minutes.

1409
01:50:48,099 --> 01:50:50,351
I want you to go up, way up.

1410
01:50:50,518 --> 01:50:53,646
Thirty seconds, bank east on my mark.
Thirty seconds.

1411
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:57,459
I'm getting him out.

1412
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:01,630
PILOT:
Target is now fully into standby.

1413
01:52:02,465 --> 01:52:03,465
Got you in sight.

1414
01:52:03,633 --> 01:52:05,050
MILLS [ON RADIO]: Get out.

1415
01:52:05,593 --> 01:52:07,428
Slowly.

1416
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:09,221
Stop.

1417
01:52:09,764 --> 01:52:11,306
Stay.

1418
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,769
What do you got?

1419
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:18,647
Dead dog.

1420
01:52:19,941 --> 01:52:21,483
I didn't do that.

1421
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:27,322
PILOT:
We're holding on standby, copy?

1422
01:52:28,324 --> 01:52:29,408
What time is it?

1423
01:52:30,326 --> 01:52:32,911
Why?
I'd like to know.

1424
01:52:36,291 --> 01:52:37,374
Seven-oh-one.

1425
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:41,754
It's close.

1426
01:52:42,839 --> 01:52:44,006
Let's go take a look.

1427
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:48,802
It's this way.

1428
01:52:51,848 --> 01:52:53,891
PILOT 1:
Bird 2, close your distance.

1429
01:52:54,058 --> 01:52:56,602
PILOT 2:
This is Bird 2. They're away from the car.

1430
01:52:56,770 --> 01:52:58,937
Coming in closer.

1431
01:53:00,815 --> 01:53:04,193
We got them. We got them. Closing in.

1432
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:05,986
PILOT 1:
Negative. Negative. Hold your go.

1433
01:53:31,971 --> 01:53:33,055
Mills?

1434
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:40,354
Down, down, down.

1435
01:53:41,356 --> 01:53:42,856
Watch him.

1436
01:53:44,108 --> 01:53:45,943
There he goes.

1437
01:53:46,152 --> 01:53:48,320
JOHN:
It's good we have some time to talk.

1438
01:53:52,408 --> 01:53:53,826
PILOT: Van approaching.

1439
01:53:53,993 --> 01:53:57,412
Stay on the guy in red. Do not take
the crosshairs off the guy in red.

1440
01:54:02,043 --> 01:54:04,670
PILOT: He's going out
to meet the van. Just stay down.

1441
01:54:05,129 --> 01:54:08,298
There's a van coming down the road.
From the north.

1442
01:54:17,475 --> 01:54:20,060
Be ready for anything, now.
Wait for my signal.

1443
01:54:20,228 --> 01:54:21,854
Wait for me.

1444
01:54:27,277 --> 01:54:29,319
Get out of the van!

1445
01:54:30,738 --> 01:54:31,780
SOMERSET [ON RADIO]: Out!

1446
01:54:31,948 --> 01:54:34,116
MAN:
Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot me.

1447
01:54:34,284 --> 01:54:35,951
Step away.

1448
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:38,620
Turn around.
Put your hands on your head.

1449
01:54:38,788 --> 01:54:40,956
CALIFORNIA:
What the hell is going on?

1450
01:54:41,124 --> 01:54:43,917
SOMERSET: What are you doing here?
I'm delivering a package.

1451
01:54:44,085 --> 01:54:45,794
I got this package for this guy, David.

1452
01:54:45,962 --> 01:54:49,256
Uh, Detective David Mills.

1453
01:54:56,222 --> 01:54:58,557
Get it. Slowly.

1454
01:54:59,434 --> 01:55:01,977
PILOT:
Stay alert. He's opening the back of the van.

1455
01:55:02,145 --> 01:55:03,812
We've got him in sight.

1456
01:55:10,069 --> 01:55:13,322
This guy paid me 500 bucks
to bring it out here, man.

1457
01:55:13,489 --> 01:55:15,574
He said he wanted it here at exactly 7:00.

1458
01:55:16,326 --> 01:55:17,826
Put it down.

1459
01:55:18,453 --> 01:55:19,786
SOMERSET: We got a box.

1460
01:55:19,954 --> 01:55:24,249
We got a box. Call the bomb squad.
I need a bomb squad. We got a box.

1461
01:55:24,709 --> 01:55:26,418
SOMERSET: Face the van.

1462
01:55:26,794 --> 01:55:28,253
Hands up.

1463
01:55:35,678 --> 01:55:37,304
Turn around.

1464
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:40,098
Okay. Go. Off you go. Go.

1465
01:55:40,266 --> 01:55:42,392
PILOT:
Do you want us to pick this guy up?

1466
01:55:43,311 --> 01:55:45,312
I'm sending the driver out on foot.

1467
01:55:48,191 --> 01:55:52,152
PILOT: Got the driver in sight.
He's headed north. Have him picked up.

1468
01:56:01,412 --> 01:56:03,330
Oh, I don't know.

1469
01:56:09,545 --> 01:56:11,046
I'm gonna open it.

1470
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:15,092
JOHN: When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.

1471
01:56:33,736 --> 01:56:34,820
SOMERSET: It's blood.

1472
01:56:34,988 --> 01:56:36,738
JOHN:
You've made quite a life for yourself.

1473
01:56:36,906 --> 01:56:37,948
MILLS: Hmm.

1474
01:56:38,116 --> 01:56:41,243
JOHN: You should be very proud.
Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.

1475
01:56:54,924 --> 01:56:56,341
PILOT:
Someone lost contact, copy.

1476
01:57:08,938 --> 01:57:10,397
California, stay away from here.

1477
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:13,025
Stay away from here, now.
Don't come in here.

1478
01:57:13,484 --> 01:57:15,193
Whatever you hear, stay away.

1479
01:57:16,404 --> 01:57:19,489
John Doe has the upper hand. Mills!

1480
01:57:19,907 --> 01:57:21,033
Here he comes.

1481
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:23,076
SOMERSET: Throw your gun down!
What?

1482
01:57:23,244 --> 01:57:25,454
I wish I could've lived like you.
Shut up.

1483
01:57:25,621 --> 01:57:28,415
What the fuck you talking about?
SOMERSET: Go away!

1484
01:57:28,583 --> 01:57:29,875
Do you hear me, detective?

1485
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:34,379
I'm trying to tell you how much
I admire you and your pretty wife.

1486
01:57:35,465 --> 01:57:37,299
What?
Tracy.

1487
01:57:37,467 --> 01:57:38,675
SOMERSET: Mills!

1488
01:57:38,843 --> 01:57:39,926
What'd you fucking say?

1489
01:57:40,094 --> 01:57:44,181
It's disturbing how easily a member
of the press can purchase information...

1490
01:57:44,348 --> 01:57:46,058
...from the men in your precinct.

1491
01:57:46,559 --> 01:57:48,060
CALIFORNIA: What the fuck?

1492
01:57:48,478 --> 01:57:50,353
SOMERSET: Throw your gun down!

1493
01:57:50,521 --> 01:57:52,564
JOHN:
I visited your home this morning...

1494
01:57:53,566 --> 01:57:55,358
After you'd left.

1495
01:57:55,526 --> 01:57:57,652
SOMERSET: Mills!
I tried to play husband.

1496
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:01,573
I tried to taste the life of a simple man.

1497
01:58:01,783 --> 01:58:03,033
SOMERSET: Throw it away!

1498
01:58:03,201 --> 01:58:05,494
Tsk, it didn't work out.

1499
01:58:05,661 --> 01:58:07,329
So...

1500
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:09,414
I took a souvenir.

1501
01:58:11,042 --> 01:58:12,751
Her pretty head.

1502
01:58:12,919 --> 01:58:14,503
SOMERSET: Mills.

1503
01:58:15,046 --> 01:58:16,671
Mills.

1504
01:58:17,673 --> 01:58:18,840
What's he talking about?

1505
01:58:19,008 --> 01:58:21,384
Give me your gun.
What's going on over there?

1506
01:58:21,552 --> 01:58:22,844
Put the, ugh... Put the gun down.

1507
01:58:23,012 --> 01:58:25,013
I saw you with a box.
What was in the box?

1508
01:58:25,181 --> 01:58:28,100
Because I envy your normal life.
Put the gun down, David.

1509
01:58:28,267 --> 01:58:31,228
It seems that envy is my sin.
Oh, what's in the box?

1510
01:58:31,395 --> 01:58:33,730
Not until you give me the gun.
What's in the box?

1511
01:58:33,898 --> 01:58:35,649
SOMERSET: Give me the gun.
He just told you.

1512
01:58:35,817 --> 01:58:39,444
You lie. You're a fucking liar, shut up.
SOMERSET: David.

1513
01:58:39,612 --> 01:58:42,364
That's what he wants.
He wants you to shoot him.

1514
01:58:42,532 --> 01:58:45,659
No! No.

1515
01:58:46,035 --> 01:58:47,828
You tell me that's not true.

1516
01:58:47,995 --> 01:58:50,122
That's not true.
Become vengeance, David.

1517
01:58:50,289 --> 01:58:53,166
Oh, she's all right. You tell me.
Become...

1518
01:58:53,334 --> 01:58:55,836
...wrath.
Tell me she's all right!

1519
01:58:56,003 --> 01:58:58,130
If you murder a suspect, David...
No.

1520
01:58:58,297 --> 01:59:00,048
SOMERSET:
You throw it all away, he knows it.

1521
01:59:00,216 --> 01:59:01,216
[YELLS] No!

1522
01:59:01,384 --> 01:59:03,385
She begged for her life.
SOMERSET: Shut up.

1523
01:59:03,553 --> 01:59:07,222
She begged for her life
and for the life of the baby inside of her.

1524
01:59:23,281 --> 01:59:24,656
Oh.

1525
01:59:26,576 --> 01:59:27,784
He didn't know.

1526
01:59:41,757 --> 01:59:43,717
Give me the gun, David.

1527
01:59:48,681 --> 01:59:50,182
David.

1528
01:59:51,475 --> 01:59:52,893
If you kill him...

1529
01:59:54,395 --> 01:59:56,146
...he will win.

1530
01:59:59,859 --> 02:00:04,070
Oh, God.

1531
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:05,947
Oh!

1532
02:00:19,378 --> 02:00:21,129
CALIFORNIA:
Oh, fuck, he shot him.

1533
02:00:43,236 --> 02:00:45,820
Set it down somewhere.

1534
02:00:47,031 --> 02:00:49,324
Come on, set us down.

1535
02:00:51,744 --> 02:00:55,538
Holy Christ. Somebody call somebody.

1536
02:00:55,706 --> 02:00:57,540
Call somebody.

1537
02:01:12,014 --> 02:01:15,058
Well, we'll take care of him.

1538
02:01:23,734 --> 02:01:25,777
Whatever he needs.

1539
02:01:26,696 --> 02:01:28,196
Where are you gonna be?

1540
02:01:30,908 --> 02:01:32,284
Around.

1541
02:01:36,622 --> 02:01:38,540
I'll be around.

1542
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:44,671
SOMERSET:
Ernest Hemingway once wrote:

1543
02:01:44,839 --> 02:01:49,259
"The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for."

1544
02:01:50,094 --> 02:01:52,679
I agree with the second part.
